☕ Java Fundamentals

This repository contains basic concepts and foundational topics of Java Programming Language. It is designed for beginners who want to build a strong understanding of core Java concepts before moving to advanced topics.

📌 About This Repository

The purpose of this project is to cover essential Java fundamentals in a simple and structured way. Each topic includes examples and explanations to help understand the core concepts clearly.

📚 Topics Covered:

1️⃣ Data Types:
Data types define the type of value a variable can store, such as int, float, char, and boolean.
In Java, they are mainly divided into primitive and non-primitive (reference) types.

2️⃣ Variables:
A variable is a container used to store data values in memory.
Each variable must have a declared data type before it can be used.

3️⃣ Operators:
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, like +, -, *, /, and ==.
Java includes arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and other types of operators.

4️⃣ Control Statements (if-else, switch):
Control statements are used to make decisions in a program based on conditions.
if-else checks boolean conditions, while switch selects a block of code from multiple options.

5️⃣ Loops (for, while, do-while):
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.
for is used when the number of iterations is known, while while and do-while depend on a condition.

🎯 Objective
